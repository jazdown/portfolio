    <h2>So... who is she?</h2>
    <p>That's me! I'm Jasmine Down, and I am a graphic designer based in Ottawa, Ontario. I love having the opportunity to work on unique, exciting, and unordinary projects. Since graduating from colouring books and crayons, I have always been passionate about excellent design. Through the past few years, I have had the amazing opportunity to experiment with different mediums and angles of design. A few that have really sparked my imagination include branding, packaging, and motion design. Stress drives me to work through tough situations well, and has shaped me into a hard working individual with great problem solving skills. </p>
