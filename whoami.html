      <h2>So... who am I?</h2>
      <p>Since graduating from colouring books and crayons, I have always been passionate about excellent design. Through the past few years, I have had the amazing opportunity to experiment with different mediums and angles of design. A few that have really sparked my imagination include branding, packaging, and motion design. Stress drives me to work through tough situations well, and has shaped me into a hard working individual with great problem solving skills. </p>
      <p>Born and raised in the Ottawa valley, my favourite things to do are fishing, camping, and having a beer just hangin' out. I love my two cats, even though they can be assholes. Being creative is something I do every day and love to learn new things.</p>
